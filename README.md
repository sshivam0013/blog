## ‚ú® Code Readability

The code in this project is structured to ensure **readability** and **maintainability**:

1. **Modular Components**: Each component is separated based on its functionality, making the code easier to navigate and scale.
2. **Descriptive Variable & Function Names**: Variables and functions have meaningful names that indicate their purpose, helping developers easily understand the code's flow.
3. **Comments**: The code is well-commented to explain the logic behind complex blocks or functions.
4. **State Management**: We use **React's `useState`** and **`useEffect`** hooks to manage component state and handle side-effects (e.g., fetching country data).
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented for fetching data from external APIs to ensure smooth user experience.
